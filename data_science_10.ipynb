    "\n",
    "Feature extraction in CNNs refers to the process of automatically\n",
    "learning and extracting meaningful representations or features from\n",
    "input data, such as images. The convolutional layers in a CNN are\n",
    "responsible for this task. These layers apply a set of learnable filters\n",
    "(also known as convolutional kernels) to input images, convolving them\n",
    "across the spatial dimensions. The filters detect different patterns or\n",
    "features, such as edges, corners, or textures, at various scales. By\n",
    "convolving the filters across the image, the CNN can capture\n",

    "Backpropagation in the context of computer vision tasks is the primary\n",
    "algorithm used to train CNNs. It involves two main steps: forward\n",
    "propagation and backward propagation. In forward propagation, the input\n",
    "data is fed into the network, and the predictions are calculated through\n",
    "the successive application of convolutional layers, activation\n",
    "functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. During this step,\n",
    "intermediate activations are stored for later use in the backward\n",
    "propagation step.\n",

    "In backward propagation (backpropagation), the loss between the\n",
    "predicted output and the true labels is calculated. This loss is then\n",
    "backpropagated through the network to compute the gradients of the\n",
    "network parameters with respect to the loss using the chain rule. The\n",
    "gradients are used to update the parameters through an optimization\n",

    "Multi-label classification in CNNs is a task where an input can belong\n",
    "to multiple classes simultaneously. Instead of assigning a single label\n",
    "to each input, multi-label classification allows for the prediction of\n",
    "multiple labels or categories. Here are a few techniques for solving\n",
    "multi-label classification tasks using CNNs: Sigmoid Activation: In\n",
    "multi-label classification, the last layer of the CNN model is typically\n",
    "modified to use sigmoid activation instead of softmax. Each output node\n",
    "in the last layer represents the probability of a specific label, and\n",
    "the sigmoid activation ensures that the outputs are independent and can\n",
    "be interpreted as the likelihood of the input belonging to each label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Cross-Entropy Loss: Binary cross-entropy loss is commonly used\n",
    "for multi-label classification. It calculates the loss between the\n",
    "predicted probabilities and the ground truth labels for each label\n",
    "independently. The losses are then averaged or summed to obtain the\n",
    "overall loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thresholding: Since multi-label classification allows for multiple\n",
    "labels per input, a threshold can be applied to the predicted\n",
    "probabilities to determine the final set of labels. The threshold\n",
    "determines the minimum probability required for a label to be considered\n",
    "present in the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: Labels in multi-label classification are often encoded\n",
    "using binary vectors, where each position represents the presence or\n",
    "absence of a specific label. For example, if there are five labels, a\n",
    "binary vector \\[1, 0, 1, 0, 0\\] indicates that the input belongs to the\n",
    "first and third labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Balancing: Imbalanced datasets, where some labels are more frequent\n",

    "Techniques such as label balancing or weighted loss functions can be\n",
    "used to ensure that the model is trained to handle all labels equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-label classification in CNNs allows for more flexible and nuanced\n",
    "predictions, where an input can belong to multiple categories\n",
    "simultaneously. The choice of threshold and loss function depends on the\n",
